# Symbiotic-Design-for-Multi-Robot-Systems
This repository contains the implementation for my Master’s thesis, “Symbiotic Design in Multi-Robot Ecosystems.” It explores cooperation among heterogeneous robots using MARL with Actor-Critic and PPO methods, applying mutualistic behavior, A* pathfinding, and collision avoidance to improve task efficiency in a grid environment.

# Overview

The goal of this project is to explore symbiotic task allocation between two types of delivery robots — small and large — operating in a shared grid environment.
By applying Actor-Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) methods, the study investigates how mutualism-inspired cooperation can improve efficiency, reduce collisions, and optimize delivery times.
