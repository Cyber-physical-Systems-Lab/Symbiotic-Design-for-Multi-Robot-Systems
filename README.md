# Symbiotic-Design-for-Multi-Robot-Systems
This repository contains the implementation for my Master’s thesis, “Symbiotic Design in Multi-Robot Ecosystems.” It explores cooperation among heterogeneous robots using MARL with Actor-Critic and PPO methods, applying mutualistic behavior, A* pathfinding, and collision avoidance to improve task efficiency in a grid environment.
